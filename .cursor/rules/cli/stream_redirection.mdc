# CLI Stream Redirection Pattern

## Description
Using process substitution (`<(echo ...)`) to provide multi-line input to commands that accept file input.

## Applications
- GitHub CLI body and comment parameters
- Git commit messages
- Any command that accepts file input

## Examples
```bash
# GitHub CLI
gh issue edit 1 --body-file <(echo '...')

# Git commit messages
git commit -F <(echo "type(scope): description\n\n- bullet point 1\n- bullet point 2")

# Any command accepting file input
diff <(echo "content1") <(echo "content2")
```

## Benefits
- Avoids creating temporary files
- Cleaner than multiple `-m` flags or escaped newlines
- Works with any command that accepts file input
- Maintains readability of multi-line content

## Implementation Notes
- Requires shell that supports process substitution (bash, zsh)
- Content should be properly escaped for the shell
- Works best with commands that accept file input via flags
