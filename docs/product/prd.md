# Product Requirements Document: Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm

## Executive Summary

The Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm is an AI-powered system designed to automatically analyze repositories and generate comprehensive documentation at the file level. The system will handle multiple programming languages and file types, extracting metadata about each file's purpose, usage, compilation/execution instructions, and design patterns. The output will be a well-organized set of markdown documentation files including architecture diagrams following the UML 4+1 View Model, rendered in PlantUML or Mermaid syntax.

## Problem Statement

CTOs and technical leaders often receive code from various sources (acquisitions, contractors, open source) with inadequate or non-existent documentation. This causes:
- Extended onboarding time for developers
- Increased maintenance complexity
- Knowledge silos within the organization
- Difficulty understanding system architecture and design

There is a critical need for a tool that can automatically generate meaningful documentation from existing codebases across multiple languages and file types.

## Target Users

Primary users are CTOs and technical leaders who:
- Receive code from various sources
- Need to quickly understand and document existing codebases
- Work with multiple programming languages and technologies
- Require comprehensive metadata about individual files and system architecture

## Product Goals & Objectives

1. Automatically generate file-level metadata for any file in a repository
2. Support multiple programming languages and file types
3. Create meaningful architecture diagrams that reflect actual code structure
4. Produce well-organized, navigable markdown documentation
5. Minimize manual intervention in the documentation process

## User Requirements

### Essential Requirements

1. As a CTO, I need to understand what each file in a repository is for, so I can comprehend the codebase structure.
2. As a technical leader, I need to know how files relate to each other, so I can understand system architecture.
3. As a developer, I need to see compilation/execution instructions, so I can work with the code effectively.
4. As a technical leader, I need to see architecture diagrams following the UML 4+1 model, so I can understand all aspects of the system design.
5. As a CTO, I need comprehensive documentation organized logically, so my team can navigate and use it efficiently.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Support for Python, Java, Rust, C++, C, C#, R#, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, shell scripts
   - Analysis of code, configuration, template, and documentation files
   - File path reporting relative to repository root

2. **File Metadata Generation**
   - File purpose identification
   - Usage context detection
   - Compilation/execution instructions (when applicable)
   - Design pattern recognition

3. **Configuration File Analysis**
   - Purpose identification
   - Parameter documentation
   - Format/schema documentation
   - Reference detection

4. **Code File Analysis**
   - Include paths and modes (C++)
   - Package/module references
   - External dependency identification
   - Class/function/interface documentation

5. **Diagram Generation (UML 4+1 View Model)**
   - **Logical View**: Class diagrams, object models, state diagrams
   - **Process View**: Sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, communication diagrams
   - **Development View**: Package diagrams, component diagrams
   - **Physical View**: Deployment diagrams
   - **+1 Scenarios View**: Use case diagrams
   - All diagrams in PlantUML or Mermaid syntax
   - Generation of appropriate diagrams based on file content and purpose

6. **Documentation Organization**
   - Markdown files in separate directory
   - Clear navigation structure
   - Cross-referencing between related files

### Future Features

1. Real-time documentation updates when code changes
2. Web portal for documentation access
3. Semantic search capabilities
4. Integration with existing documentation systems

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Repository analysis should complete within a reasonable timeframe based on repository size
2. **Accuracy**: Documentation should accurately reflect actual code structure and behavior
3. **Usability**: Documentation should be easy to navigate and understand
4. **Extensibility**: System should be designed to accommodate new languages and file types

## Success Metrics

1. Reduction in time needed to understand a new codebase
2. Completeness of generated documentation (percentage of files with meaningful metadata)
3. Accuracy of architecture diagrams compared to actual system design
4. User satisfaction with documentation quality and organization

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Initial Release)
- Core repository analysis engine
- Support for primary languages (Python, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Basic metadata generation
- Simple architecture diagrams
- Markdown documentation generation

### Phase 2
- Expanded language support (C++, C, Rust, etc.)
- Enhanced configuration file analysis
- More detailed architecture diagrams
- Improved documentation organization

### Phase 3
- Support for remaining languages
- Advanced design pattern recognition
- Comprehensive relationship mapping
- Documentation quality enhancements
