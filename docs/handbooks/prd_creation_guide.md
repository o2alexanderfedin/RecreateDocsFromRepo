# PRD Creation Guide

## What is a PRD?
A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a comprehensive document that outlines what is being built, why it's being built, who it's for, and how success will be measured. It serves as the source of truth for the product team and stakeholders.

## PRD Creation Process

### 1. Research & Discovery
- Interview existing/potential users about their pain points
- Analyze competitors and similar solutions
- Review industry trends and best practices
- Gather inputs from sales, support, and other internal teams
- Identify technical constraints and opportunities

### 2. Define the Problem & Opportunity
- Clearly articulate the problem being solved
- Identify who experiences this problem
- Quantify the impact of the problem (time/money lost)
- Outline the market opportunity

### 3. Outline Product Vision & Goals
- Create a compelling vision statement
- Define measurable goals and objectives
- Link to broader company strategy
- Set clear success criteria

### 4. User Requirements
- Detail who the users are (personas)
- Document use cases and user flows
- Prioritize user needs
- Map user journeys

### 5. Feature Requirements
- List core features and functionalities
- Prioritize features (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- Include non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Set acceptance criteria for each feature

### 6. Constraints & Assumptions
- Document technical constraints
- Note business constraints (time, budget, resources)
- List assumptions being made
- Identify dependencies and risks

### 7. Success Metrics
- Define KPIs to measure success
- Set benchmarks and targets
- Outline how data will be collected and analyzed
- Plan for ongoing measurement

### 8. Review & Validation
- Share draft with stakeholders for feedback
- Validate assumptions with users/customers
- Make necessary revisions
- Get final approval from key stakeholders

## PRD Template Sections

   - What the product aims to achieve

5. **User Requirements**
   - Needs and expectations of users

6. **Feature Requirements**

7. **Non-functional Requirements**
   - Performance, security, usability, etc.

8. **Constraints & Assumptions**
   - Technical, business, and other limitations

9. **Success Metrics**
   - How product success will be measured

10. **Timeline & Roadmap**
    - High-level implementation schedule

11. **Appendices**
    - Supporting research, mockups, diagrams, etc.

## Best Practices
- Keep it clear and concise
- Use visuals where appropriate (wireframes, diagrams)
- Focus on the "what" not the "how"
- Make it accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Version control the document
- Update as requirements evolve
- Link to related documents (user research, competitive analysis)
