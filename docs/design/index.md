# File Analyzer System Design Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive design documentation for the File Analyzer system, which provides automated analysis of code repositories to extract file types, code structure, frameworks, and other metadata for documentation generation.

## Document Index

### Core Architecture

1. [**System Architecture**](system_architecture.md)
   - High-level system overview
   - Component diagrams
   - Design goals and principles
   - Key workflows

2. [**Component Interactions**](component_interactions.md)
   - Detailed sequence diagrams
   - Component communication patterns
   - Error handling flows
   - Data passing between modules

### Feature-Specific Design

3. [**Framework Detection**](framework_detection.md)
   - Framework detection architecture
   - Rule-based signature matching
   - Version extraction process
   - Repository-wide analysis
   - Framework usage tracking

4. [**AI Integration**](ai_integration.md)
   - AI provider architecture
   - Prompt engineering details
   - Response handling and parsing
   - Error recovery strategies
   - Model selection guidance

## UML Diagrams

The documentation includes various UML diagrams using Mermaid notation:

### Class Diagrams
- Core components class diagram
- AI provider class hierarchy
- Cache system class design

### Sequence Diagrams
- Repository analysis workflow
- Framework detection process
- AI analysis with fallback mechanisms
- Cache access patterns

### Flow Diagrams
- Error handling flows
- Decision processes
- Extension mechanisms

## Key Design Patterns

The File Analyzer system implements several important design patterns:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different AI providers implement the same interface
2. **Factory Pattern**: Cache factory creates appropriate implementations
3. **Composite Pattern**: Cache manager combines multiple providers
4. **Adapter Pattern**: AI providers adapt external APIs to internal interfaces
5. **Builder Pattern**: Analysis results are constructed incrementally
6. **Chain of Responsibility**: Analysis flows through multiple components

## Using This Documentation

- Start with the **System Architecture** document for a high-level overview
- Use the **Component Interactions** document to understand data flow
- Refer to feature-specific documents for implementation details
- Consult diagrams to understand relationships between components

## Contributing to Design

When adding new features or making significant changes to the system, please:

1. Update the relevant design documents
2. Add or modify UML diagrams to reflect changes
3. Document extension points for future development
4. Include rationale for design decisions
