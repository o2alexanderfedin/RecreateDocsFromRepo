# Epic: Documentation Generation

## Description
This epic covers the generation of comprehensive documentation from the repository analysis data. It focuses on creating meaningful, well-organized documentation artifacts including file metadata, architecture diagrams, and navigation structures.

## Business Value
By automatically generating high-quality documentation, we enable organizations to quickly understand unfamiliar codebases, onboard new team members more efficiently, and maintain up-to-date documentation with minimal manual effort.

## User Impact
CTOs and technical teams will gain immediate insight into codebase structure and behavior through comprehensive documentation, significantly reducing the time and effort needed to understand and work with new code.

## Technical Scope
- File-level metadata documentation
- UML diagram generation following the 4+1 View Model
- Documentation organization and navigation
- Markdown formatting with proper linking
