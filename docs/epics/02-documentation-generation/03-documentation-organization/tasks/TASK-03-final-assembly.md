# Engineering Task: Implement Final Assembly

## Task ID
DOC-03-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[Documentation Organization](../03-documentation-organization.md)

## Description
Create a system that assembles all generated documentation components (file documentation, diagrams, navigation) into a complete, cohesive documentation package ready for use.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System assembles all documentation components into the final structure
2. Assembly includes:
   - Index/overview pages
   - Architecture documentation with diagrams
   - Component and file documentation
   - Navigation elements
   - Cross-references and relationships
3. Assembly resolves all internal links and references
4. System validates the completed documentation
5. Assembly handles large documentation sets appropriately
6. System generates a final README with usage instructions
7. Final documentation package is self-contained
8. Assembly includes metadata about generation (date, version, etc.)

## Technical Notes
- Implement assembly sequence and dependency management
- Create validation for the final documentation package
- Design overview page templates with key information
- Implement link validation and resolution
- Consider generating different output formats
- Include documentation about the documentation itself
- Create final checks for completeness and correctness

## Notes
Final assembly is the last step in creating cohesive, usable documentation that brings together all the individual components into a complete package.
