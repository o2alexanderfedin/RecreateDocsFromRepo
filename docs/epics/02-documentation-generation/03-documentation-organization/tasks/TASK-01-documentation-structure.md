# Engineering Task: Implement Documentation Structure

## Task ID
DOC-03-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[Documentation Organization](../03-documentation-organization.md)

## Description
Create a system that organizes generated documentation into a clear hierarchical structure with appropriate categorization, grouping, and navigation paths.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System creates a hierarchical documentation structure including:
   - Overview/index page
   - Architecture section with UML diagrams
   - Components section organized by module/package
   - File listings with appropriate categorization
   - Cross-reference section showing relationships
2. Structure reflects the logical organization of the codebase
3. Files are grouped by module, package, or functionality
4. Structure includes appropriate depth based on codebase size
5. Similar files are grouped together for easy navigation
6. Generated structure is consistent across different codebases
7. System creates appropriate directory structure for documentation files
8. Organization includes consideration for future updates

## Technical Notes
- Design flexible organization schemas for different codebase types
- Use component grouping data for structure guidance
- Implement directory creation and file placement
- Create index files for each directory level
- Consider using AI to identify logical documentation groupings
- Implement naming conventions for files and directories
- Ensure structure works with standard markdown viewers

## Dependencies
- REPO-05-TASK-02 (Component Grouping)
- DOC-01-TASK-01 (AI Documentation Generator)
- DOC-02-TASK-01 (Logical View Diagrams)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
The documentation structure is crucial for usability, as even the best-written documentation is of limited value if users cannot find what they need.
