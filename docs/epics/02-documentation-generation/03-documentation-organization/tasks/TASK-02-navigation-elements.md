## Description
Create a system that generates navigation aids for documentation, including table of contents, breadcrumb navigation, internal links, and cross-references to help users easily navigate through the documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates a comprehensive table of contents for the entire documentation
2. Each page includes breadcrumb navigation showing path in hierarchy
3. Documentation includes navigation headers/footers with common links
4. System creates section navigation within long documents
5. Related files are cross-linked based on relationships
6. Component diagrams link to detailed documentation
7. System implements anchors for section navigation
8. Navigation is consistent across all documentation
9. Links are relative to support different hosting scenarios

## Technical Notes
- Generate table of contents automatically from document structure
- Implement breadcrumb generation based on file paths
- Create templates for headers and footers
- Use relationship data to generate cross-references
- Implement anchor generation for section links
- Ensure navigation works in standard Markdown viewers
