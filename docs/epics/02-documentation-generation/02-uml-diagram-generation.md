# User Story: UML Diagram Generation

## Epic

## User Story
As a technical leader, I want the system to generate UML diagrams following the 4+1 View Model so that I can understand the system architecture from multiple perspectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates Logical View diagrams:
   - Class diagrams showing inheritance and implementation relationships
   - Object models showing key instances and their relationships
   - State diagrams for components with significant state transitions

2. System generates Process View diagrams:
   - Sequence diagrams for key workflows
   - Activity diagrams showing process flows
   - Communication diagrams showing object interactions

3. System generates Development View diagrams:
   - Package diagrams showing code organization
   - Component diagrams showing high-level components and their dependencies

4. System generates Physical View diagrams:
   - Deployment diagrams showing runtime components and infrastructure

5. System generates Scenarios (Use Case) View diagrams:
   - Use case diagrams showing system functionality from user perspective

6. All diagrams are rendered using either PlantUML or Mermaid syntax

7. System selects appropriate diagram types based on file/component content:
   - Interface files generate class/interface diagrams
   - Service implementations generate sequence diagrams
   - Configuration files contribute to deployment diagrams

8. Diagrams include appropriate level of detail without being overwhelming

9. Diagrams are properly linked from relevant documentation pages

## Technical Notes
- Will need algorithms to extract diagram elements from analysis data
- Consider visualization limits (avoid too many elements in a single diagram)
- May need clustering/grouping for complex relationships
- PlantUML/Mermaid have syntax limitations to consider

## Dependencies
- [Repository Analysis Epic](../01-repository-analysis/epic.md) - Specifically relationship mapping
- [File Metadata Documentation](01-file-metadata-documentation.md) - For linking

## Effort Estimate
Large (4-6 weeks)

## Priority
Must Have (1)
