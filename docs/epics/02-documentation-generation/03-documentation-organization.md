## User Story
As a CTO, I want the generated documentation to be well-organized with clear navigation so that my team can efficiently find and use the information they need.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates documentation with a clear hierarchical structure:
   - Overview/index page
   - Architecture section with UML diagrams
   - Components section organized by module/package
   - File listings with appropriate categorization
   - Cross-reference section showing relationships

2. Documentation includes navigation aids:
   - Table of contents
   - Breadcrumb navigation
   - Search capability (if possible)
   - Consistent header/footer with navigation links

3. Related documentation is properly linked:
   - Files reference their diagrams
   - Diagrams link to relevant files
   - Dependencies link to their documentation
   - Related components link to each other

4. Documentation organization reflects the logical structure of the codebase

5. Generated documentation follows consistent styling and formatting

6. Documentation structure is customizable through configuration settings

## Technical Notes
- Will need index generation for multiple views of the same content
- Consider static site generators for enhanced navigation
- May need to handle very large repositories with pagination or splitting
- Links should be relative to work in various hosting scenarios

## Dependencies
- [File Metadata Documentation](01-file-metadata-documentation.md)
- [UML Diagram Generation](02-uml-diagram-generation.md)

## Effort Estimate
Medium (2-3 weeks)
