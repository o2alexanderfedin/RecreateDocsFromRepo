# Engineering Task: Implement Physical and Scenarios View Diagrams

## Task ID
DOC-02-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[UML Diagram Generation](../02-uml-diagram-generation.md)

## Description
Create a system that generates UML Physical View diagrams (deployment) and Scenarios View diagrams (use case) using PlantUML or Mermaid syntax based on repository analysis data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates deployment diagrams showing:
   - Runtime components
   - Infrastructure elements
   - Deployment nodes and artifacts
   - Communication paths
   - Environment configurations
2. System generates use case diagrams showing:
   - System functionality from user perspective
   - Actors and their interactions
   - Use case relationships
   - System boundaries
3. Diagrams use PlantUML or Mermaid syntax
4. Deployment diagrams leverage configuration file analysis
5. Use case diagrams derived from code structure and documentation
6. System generates appropriate level of detail
7. Diagrams use consistent styling and layout
8. Diagrams include titles, descriptions, and timestamps

## Technical Notes
- Use configuration file analysis to identify deployment elements
- Implement AI-based detection of use cases from code and docs
- Design layout algorithms for diagram clarity
- Create templates for different diagram types
- Consider using AI to generate deployment scenarios
- Implement consistent styling across diagrams
- Include proper labeling and annotations

## Dependencies
- REPO-04-TASK-03 (Config Documentation Generator)
- REPO-05-TASK-01 (AI Relationship Analyzer)
- REPO-05-TASK-03 (Relationship Visualization)
- DOC-02-TASK-01 (Logical View Diagrams)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Physical and Scenarios View diagrams complete the UML 4+1 View Model, showing how the system is deployed and how it appears to users, providing essential context for understanding the full system.
