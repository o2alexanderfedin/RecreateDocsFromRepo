# Engineering Task: Implement Logical View Diagrams

## Task ID
DOC-02-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[UML Diagram Generation](../02-uml-diagram-generation.md)

## Description
Create a system that generates UML Logical View diagrams (class diagrams, object models, state diagrams) using PlantUML or Mermaid syntax based on the relationship data extracted during repository analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates class diagrams showing:
   - Classes and interfaces
   - Inheritance relationships
   - Implementation relationships
   - Composition and aggregation
   - Important attributes and methods
2. System generates object models showing:
   - Key instance relationships
   - Runtime collaborations
   - Important object states
3. System generates state diagrams for:
   - Components with significant state transitions
   - Workflow processes
   - Complex state machines
4. Diagrams use PlantUML or Mermaid syntax
5. Generation includes appropriate level of detail based on codebase size
6. Diagrams use consistent styling and layout
7. System handles large class hierarchies through clustering
8. Diagrams include titles, descriptions, and timestamps

## Technical Notes
- Use AI to generate diagram code from relationship data
- Implement filtering strategies for appropriate detail level
- Design layout algorithms for complex diagrams
- Create templates for different diagram types
- Consider using AI to identify state machines in code
- Implement consistent styling across diagrams
- Include proper labeling and annotations

## Dependencies
- REPO-05-TASK-01 (AI Relationship Analyzer)
- REPO-05-TASK-02 (Component Grouping)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Logical View diagrams provide the structural perspective of the system, showing classes, objects, and states that are essential for understanding system design.
