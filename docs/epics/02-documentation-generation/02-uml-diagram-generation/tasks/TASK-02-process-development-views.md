# Engineering Task: Implement Process and Development View Diagrams

## Task ID
DOC-02-TASK-02

## Parent User Story
[UML Diagram Generation](../02-uml-diagram-generation.md)

## Description
Create a system that generates UML Process View diagrams (sequence, activity, communication) and Development View diagrams (package, component) using PlantUML or Mermaid syntax based on repository analysis data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates sequence diagrams showing:
   - Object interactions over time
   - Method calls and returns
   - Key workflows and processes
   - System entry points and execution paths
2. System generates activity diagrams showing:
   - Business processes
   - Complex algorithms
   - Decision flows
   - Parallel activities
3. System generates package diagrams showing:
   - Code organization
   - Module dependencies
   - Layer structures
4. System generates component diagrams showing:
   - High-level components
   - Interfaces and ports
   - Component dependencies
5. Diagrams use PlantUML or Mermaid syntax
6. Generation includes appropriate level of detail
7. Diagrams use consistent styling and layout
8. System generates diagrams for the most important processes

## Technical Notes
- Use AI to identify key workflows for sequence diagrams
- Implement algorithms to trace method calls for sequences
- Design layout strategies for complex diagrams
- Create templates for different diagram types
- Use component grouping data for package diagrams
- Consider using AI to identify important processes
- Balance diagram completeness with readability

## Dependencies
- REPO-05-TASK-01 (AI Relationship Analyzer)
- REPO-05-TASK-02 (Component Grouping)
- REPO-05-TASK-03 (Relationship Visualization)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Process and Development View diagrams show how the system behaves at runtime and how it's organized for development, providing crucial information about system dynamics and structure.
