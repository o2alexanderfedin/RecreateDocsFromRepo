# Engineering Task: Implement AI Documentation Generator

## Task ID
DOC-01-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[File Metadata Documentation](../01-file-metadata-documentation.md)

## Description
Create a system that uses AI to generate comprehensive documentation for individual files based on the metadata extracted during repository analysis, producing clear and informative file-level documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates documentation for each file using AI
2. Documentation includes:
   - File purpose and description
   - Key components defined in the file
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Usage examples
   - Compilation/execution instructions (where applicable)
3. AI uses both extracted metadata and file content for generation
4. Documentation includes appropriate syntax highlighting for code examples
5. Generation handles different file types appropriately:
   - For code files: includes class/function documentation
   - For configuration files: includes parameter documentation
   - For build files: includes build instruction documentation
6. Documentation links to related files based on relationships
7. AI generates accurate, human-readable explanations
8. System handles large files by providing summaries with expandable sections

## Technical Notes
- Design specialized prompts for documentation generation
- Use extracted metadata to guide the AI
- Consider using a two-stage approach: summary generation followed by details
- Implement templates for different file types
- Optimize token usage for cost efficiency
- Include examples of good documentation in prompts
- Use relationship data to add context about file usage

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer)
- REPO-02-TASK-04 (Metadata Standardization) - For primary languages
- REPO-03-TASK-03 (Metadata Integration) - For secondary languages
- REPO-04-TASK-03 (Config Documentation Generator) - For configuration files

## Estimated Effort
Medium (8 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
This task leverages AI to transform raw metadata into clear, concise documentation that helps developers understand each file's purpose and functionality.
