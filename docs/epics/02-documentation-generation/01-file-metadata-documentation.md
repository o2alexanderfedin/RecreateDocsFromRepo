# User Story: File Metadata Documentation

## Story ID
DOC-01

## Epic
[Documentation Generation](epic.md)

## User Story
As a developer working with an unfamiliar codebase, I want detailed metadata documentation for each file so that I can quickly understand its purpose, functionality, and usage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates a markdown document for each file containing:
   - File path (relative to repository root)
   - File purpose/description
   - Key components defined in the file
   - Dependencies (imports, includes, etc.)
   - Usage examples (where applicable)
   - Compilation/execution instructions (where applicable)

2. Documentation includes appropriate syntax highlighting for code examples

3. Documentation links to related files based on the relationship mapping

4. Generation handles special file types appropriately:
   - For code files: includes class/function documentation
   - For configuration files: includes parameter documentation
   - For build files: includes build instruction documentation

5. Documentation is accurate and reflects the actual content of the files

6. System handles large files by providing summaries with expandable sections

## Technical Notes
- Will need templating system for different file types
- Consider markdown extensions for improved formatting
- Documentation should handle code with special characters
- May need to limit detail for very large files

## Dependencies
- [Repository Analysis Epic](../01-repository-analysis/epic.md) - Must have file analysis data

## Effort Estimate
Medium (2-3 weeks)

## Priority
Must Have (1)
