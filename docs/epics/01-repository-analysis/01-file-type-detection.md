# User Story: File Type Detection

## Story ID
REPO-01

## Epic
[Repository Analysis](epic.md)

## User Story
As a CTO receiving an unfamiliar codebase, I want the system to automatically detect file types in the repository so that appropriate analysis can be applied to each file without manual classification.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System can detect file types based on extensions, shebangs, content patterns, and other identifiers
2. System correctly classifies files into categories:
   - Code files (by language)
   - Configuration files (by type)
   - Documentation files
   - Build/deployment files
   - Resource files
3. System correctly determines the relative path of each file to the repository root
4. System identifies binary files and excludes them from inappropriate text analysis
5. Detection works on repositories with 10,000+ files with acceptable performance
6. Accuracy of file type detection is at least 95% for common file types

## Technical Notes
- Will require file extension database
- May need content-based heuristics for files without extensions
- Consider using magic bytes for binary file detection
- Should handle symlinks appropriately

## Dependencies
None

## Effort Estimate
Medium (2-3 weeks)

## Priority
Must Have (1)
