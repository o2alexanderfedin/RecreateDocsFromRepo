# Engineering Task: Implement Config Documentation Generator

## Task ID
REPO-04-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[Config File Analysis](../04-config-file-analysis.md)

## Description
Create a system that generates comprehensive documentation for configuration files, including parameter details, usage examples, and deployment guidance based on AI analysis results.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates documentation for all analyzed configuration files
2. Documentation includes:
   - Configuration file purpose and role
   - Parameter descriptions and types
   - Default values and constraints
   - Required vs. optional parameters
   - Usage examples
   - Relationships to code components
   - Environment-specific considerations
   - Security considerations
3. Documentation uses consistent format across different config file types
4. Generation handles missing or uncertain information appropriately
5. Documentation includes visual representation of config structure where appropriate
6. System flags parameters that may need special attention (security, performance, etc.)

## Technical Notes
- Design documentation templates for different config types
- Use AI to generate usage examples and explanations
- Include schema visualization for structured formats
- Integrate with relationship data for context
- Include deployment considerations in documentation
- Consider generating sample configurations
- Include validation rules and constraints

## Dependencies
- REPO-04-TASK-01 (AI Config Analyzer)
- REPO-04-TASK-02 (Config Relationship Mapper)

## Estimated Effort
Small (4 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Clear configuration documentation is essential for system deployment and operation, especially for complex systems with multiple configuration points.
