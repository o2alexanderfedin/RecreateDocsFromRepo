# Engineering Task: Implement AI Config Analyzer

## Task ID
REPO-04-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[Config File Analysis](../04-config-file-analysis.md)

## Description
Create a system that uses AI models to analyze configuration files (JSON, YAML, XML, properties, etc.) to extract parameters, structure, and purpose for documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System analyzes common configuration file formats:
   - JSON (including package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
   - YAML (including docker-compose.yml, github workflows, etc.)
   - XML (including pom.xml, web.xml, etc.)
   - INI/properties files
   - Environment files (.env)
2. Analysis extracts:
   - Configuration parameters and their purpose
   - Default values
   - Parameter types and constraints
   - Required vs. optional parameters
   - Relationships to other components
   - Overall purpose of the configuration file
3. System identifies configuration files for common frameworks and provides context
4. Analysis detects environment-specific configurations
5. System flags potential security issues (hardcoded credentials, etc.)
6. Analysis provides confidence level with results
7. System returns results in a structured format

## Technical Notes
- Design specialized prompts for configuration analysis
- Include file format and path in context
- Generate structured JSON output
- Optimize prompts for different configuration formats
- Include example parameters and formats in prompts
- Consider special handling for templated configurations
- Include framework-specific knowledge in prompts

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer) - For identifying config files

## Estimated Effort
