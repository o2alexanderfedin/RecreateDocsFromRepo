# Engineering Task: Implement Config Relationship Mapper

## Task ID
REPO-04-TASK-02

## Parent User Story
[Config File Analysis](../04-config-file-analysis.md)

## Description
Create a system that identifies relationships between configuration files and code files, mapping how configurations affect system behavior and connecting them to their usage context.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies references to configuration values in code
2. System maps configuration files to the components that use them
3. Relationship mapping includes:
   - Direct references (file loading, parameter access)
   - Implicit dependencies (configuration determining component behavior)
   - Environment variable references
   - Command line argument mappings
4. System identifies the scope and impact of configuration changes
5. Mapping works across different languages and file formats
6. System handles configuration hierarchies and overrides
7. Results include bidirectional relationships (config-to-code and code-to-config)

## Technical Notes
- Use AI to identify how configurations are loaded in code
- Analyze code patterns for configuration usage
- Create cross-reference mapping between config parameters and code
- Implement global analysis to connect related components
- Consider framework-specific configuration loading patterns
- Use code context to enhance relationship detection

## Dependencies
