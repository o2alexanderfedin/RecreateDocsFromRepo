# Epic: Repository Analysis

## Description
This epic covers the core repository scanning and analysis functionality that serves as the foundation for the Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm. It focuses on the engine that will extract information from various file types across multiple programming languages.

## Business Value
By building a robust repository analysis engine, we create the foundation for all subsequent documentation generation. This enables users to quickly understand unfamiliar codebases and reduces the time needed for developers to become productive with new code.

## User Impact
CTOs and technical leaders will be able to automatically scan repositories of any type and extract meaningful metadata without manual analysis, saving significant time and resources.

## Technical Scope
- Support for multiple programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C#, etc.)
- File type detection and appropriate analysis strategy
- Metadata extraction from code, configuration, and documentation files
- Relationship mapping between files and components
