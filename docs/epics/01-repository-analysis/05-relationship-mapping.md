# User Story: Relationship Mapping

## Story ID
REPO-05

## Epic
[Repository Analysis](epic.md)

## User Story
As a technical leader, I want to understand how different files and components in the repository relate to each other so that I can grasp the overall system architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies and maps relationships between files:
   - Import/include dependencies
   - Inheritance relationships
   - Implementation relationships
   - Usage relationships (function calls, instantiation)

2. System determines directionality of relationships (which component depends on which)

3. System identifies and categorizes components by their role:
   - Core components
   - Utility components
   - Configuration components
   - Test components
   - External dependencies

4. System detects module boundaries:
   - Packages/namespaces
   - Directories with special meaning
   - Build module definitions

5. Relationship mapping works across different languages in the same repository

6. System handles circular dependencies and complex relationship graphs

7. Mapping is complete enough to generate meaningful architecture diagrams

## Technical Notes
- Will require cross-file analysis
- Graph data structure for representing relationships
- Consider scalability for large repositories (10,000+ files)
- May need to implement language-specific relationship detection rules
