# User Story: Configuration File Analysis

## Story ID
REPO-04

## Epic
[Repository Analysis](epic.md)

## User Story
As a developer working with an unfamiliar codebase, I want to understand configuration files (JSON, YAML, XML, properties, etc.) so that I can properly configure and deploy the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System correctly identifies common configuration file formats:
   - JSON (including package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
   - YAML (including docker-compose.yml, github workflows, etc.)
   - XML (including pom.xml, web.xml, etc.)
   - INI/properties files
   - Environment files (.env)

2. For each configuration file, system extracts:
   - Purpose of the configuration (based on filename, path, and content)
   - Available parameters and their format/schema
   - Default values
   - Required vs optional parameters
   - References to other files/components

3. System identifies configuration files specific to common frameworks and provides context:
   - Spring (application.properties, application.yml)
   - Node.js (package.json, .npmrc)
   - Django (settings.py)
   - Docker (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
   - CI/CD configurations (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml)

4. Analysis includes detection of environment-specific configurations

5. System detects potential security issues (hardcoded credentials, etc.)

## Technical Notes
- Will require format-specific parsers
- May need schema detection for structured formats
- Consider integration with schema validators
- Should handle templated configuration files (with variables)

## Dependencies
- [01-file-type-detection](01-file-type-detection.md)

## Effort Estimate
Medium (2-3 weeks)

## Priority
Must Have (1)
