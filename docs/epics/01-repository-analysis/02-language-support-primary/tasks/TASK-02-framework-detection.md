# Engineering Task: Implement Framework Detection

## Task ID
REPO-02-TASK-02

## Parent User Story
[Primary Language Support](../02-language-support-primary.md)

## Description
Create a system that uses AI and heuristics to detect frameworks and libraries in use across primary languages, providing contextual information for documentation generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies common frameworks for each primary language:
   - Python: Django, Flask, FastAPI, Pandas, Numpy, etc.
   - Java: Spring, Hibernate, Jakarta EE, etc.
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: React, Angular, Vue, Express, etc.
2. Detection uses both explicit evidence (imports, annotations) and code patterns
3. System identifies version information when available
4. Detection provides confidence level for each identified framework
5. System extracts framework-specific patterns and structures
6. Results include how frameworks are being used in the codebase
7. Detection handles mixed framework usage in the same codebase

## Technical Notes
- Create specialized prompts for framework detection
- Include common framework signatures and patterns in prompts
- Analyze multiple files in context when necessary
- Provide batch analysis capability for related files
- Consider global analysis across the repository for better detection
- Implement confidence scoring system for detections

## Dependencies
- REPO-02-TASK-01 (AI Code Analyzer)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Framework detection provides crucial context for understanding code structure and purpose, and will enhance the quality of generated documentation.
