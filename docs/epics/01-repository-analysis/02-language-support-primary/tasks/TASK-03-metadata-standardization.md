# Engineering Task: Implement Metadata Standardization

## Task ID
REPO-02-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[Primary Language Support](../02-language-support-primary.md)

## Description
Create a system to standardize and normalize the metadata extracted from different languages and frameworks into a consistent format for documentation generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System defines a standard schema for code metadata
2. Schema handles language-specific concepts in a normalized way
3. System converts AI analysis output to the standard schema
4. Standardized metadata includes:
   - Components (classes, functions, etc.) with consistent typing
   - Relationships (inheritance, implementation, usage)
   - Dependencies (libraries, imports, etc.)
   - Documentation (comments, usage examples)
   - Purpose and context information
5. System handles language-specific features appropriately
6. Standardization process preserves important details while normalizing format
7. Output format is suitable for documentation generation
8. System handles metadata from all primary languages

## Technical Notes
- Design extensible JSON schema for metadata
- Implement adapter pattern for language-specific conversions
- Include schema version for future compatibility
- Balance standardization with preserving language-specific details
- Consider using JSON Schema for validation
- Include mechanism for handling unknown or partial metadata

## Dependencies
- REPO-02-TASK-01 (AI Code Analyzer)
- REPO-02-TASK-02 (Framework Detection)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Standardized metadata is essential for generating consistent documentation across different languages and frameworks.
