# Engineering Task: Implement AI Code Analyzer

## Task ID
REPO-02-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[Primary Language Support](../02-language-support-primary.md)

## Description
Create a system that uses AI models to analyze code files in primary languages (Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript) to extract structural information, dependencies, and documentation for comprehensive documentation generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System accepts code file content and metadata as input
2. System uses AI model (e.g., GPT-4 or similar) to analyze code structure
3. Analysis extracts:
   - Classes, functions, and methods
   - Important comments and documentation
   - Dependencies and imports
   - Relationships between components
   - Frameworks and libraries in use
   - Purpose and key functionality
4. System works with all primary languages (Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript)
5. Analysis returns consistent structured output format regardless of language
6. Analysis handles files up to reasonable size limits
7. System provides confidence level with analysis
8. Analysis completes within acceptable time limits

## Technical Notes
- Design specialized prompts for code analysis
- Include file type and language in context
- Implement structured output format (JSON)
- Consider using prompt chaining for complex files
- Implement chunking for large files
- Include examples of expected output in prompts
- Optimize token usage for cost efficiency

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer) - For language identification

## Estimated Effort
Medium (8 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
This AI-based approach allows for rapid development of code analysis capabilities across multiple languages without creating specialized parsers for each language.
