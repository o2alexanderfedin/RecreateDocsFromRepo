# Engineering Task: Implement Integration Testing

## Task ID
REPO-02-TASK-04

## Parent User Story
[Primary Language Support](../02-language-support-primary.md)

## Description
Create integration tests to verify that the AI-based code analysis system correctly extracts and standardizes metadata from primary language code files, ensuring the system meets accuracy and consistency requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tests cover all primary languages (Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript)
2. Tests include various code patterns for each language:
   - Object-oriented vs. functional code
   - Different frameworks and libraries
   - Various documentation styles
   - Complex inheritance and dependencies
3. Tests verify extraction of:
   - Classes and functions
   - Documentation and comments
   - Dependencies and imports
   - Framework usage
4. Tests verify standardization of metadata
5. Tests verify handling of edge cases:
   - Uncommon coding patterns
   - Large files
   - Files with minimal documentation
6. Tests measure and report on extraction accuracy
7. Tests are automated and repeatable

## Technical Notes
- Create test fixtures with representative code samples
- Include real-world code samples when possible
- Mock AI API responses for predictable testing
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Measure and report on metadata quality
- Include performance benchmarks in test output

## Dependencies
- REPO-02-TASK-01 (AI Code Analyzer)
- REPO-02-TASK-02 (Framework Detection)
- REPO-02-TASK-03 (Metadata Standardization)

## Estimated Effort
Small (4 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Testing with real AI API calls should be limited to avoid unnecessary costs. Most tests should use mocked responses.
