# AI File Type Analyzer - Implementation Complete

The AI File Type Analyzer component has been successfully implemented with all tests passing. This component uses AI models to analyze files and determine their type, language, and purpose.

## Features

- SOLID design principles for maintainability and extensibility
- Multiple AI provider support (Mistral, OpenAI, Mock)
- Caching system to reduce API costs and improve performance
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- CLI interface for easy use

## Testing

### Unit & Mock Tests
All unit and mock-based tests are now passing. The tests cover:
- Core functionality of the file analyzer
- Caching system
- File reading and hashing
- Mock AI provider

### Integration Tests
Several integration tests verify the system works end-to-end:
- Basic end-to-end flow with the mock provider
- Repository analysis with complex directory structures
- CLI interface testing
- Repository statistics generation

### Real API Integration Tests
We've added integration tests that use the real Mistral AI API. These tests:
- Analyze Python, JSON, and Markdown files with the real API
- Test the CLI interface with real API calls
- Are skipped if no API key is provided

## Running Real API Tests

To run tests with the real Mistral API:

1. Get an API key from [Mistral AI Platform](https://mistral.ai/)

2. Use the provided script:
   ```bash
   ./run_real_api_tests.sh YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY
   ```

3. Alternatively, set the environment variable manually:
   ```bash
   export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key
   python3 -m pytest src/file_analyzer/tests/test_real_api.py -v
   ```

## Next Steps

- Implement the Repository Scanner (REPO-01-TASK-02)
- Enhance the caching system (REPO-01-TASK-03)
- Add more comprehensive integration testing (REPO-01-TASK-04)
