# Engineering Task: Implement Analysis Caching System

## Task ID
REPO-01-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[File Type Detection](../01-file-type-detection.md)

## Description
Create a caching system to store and retrieve AI analysis results, reducing API costs and improving performance for repeated analyses of the same or similar files.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System caches AI analysis results by file content hash
2. Cache lookups occur before making AI API calls
3. Cache hit rate is logged and reportable
4. Cache can be persisted to disk for reuse across sessions
5. Cache implements efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms
6. Cache includes expiration/invalidation strategy
7. System provides methods to pre-warm cache with common file types
8. Cache handles collisions appropriately

## Technical Notes
- Use content hashing for cache keys
- Consider LRU (Least Recently Used) caching strategy
- Implement serialization/deserialization of cached results
- Consider SQLite or similar for persistent storage
- Include mechanism to invalidate cache entries if AI model changes
- Consider partial matching for similar files to increase hit rate

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer)

## Estimated Effort
Small (4 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status

## Notes
An effective caching system is crucial for managing API costs and improving performance in production use.
