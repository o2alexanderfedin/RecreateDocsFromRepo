# Repository Scanner - Implementation Complete (v0.1.0)

The Repository Scanner component has been successfully implemented with all tests passing. This component recursively scans repository structures, handles file discovery, filtering, and prepares files for AI-based analysis.

## Features

- Recursive directory traversal with configurable exclusion patterns
- Intelligent file filtering to exclude binary files, large files, and common exclusions
- Priority-based file processing for important files (READMEs, config files, etc.)
- Both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes
- Concurrency control and batch processing to optimize API usage
- Progress reporting for large repositories
- Comprehensive file statistics collection
- Full test coverage

## Implementation Details

### RepositoryScanner Class
The core `RepositoryScanner` class provides:
- Default exclusion patterns for binary files and common directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, etc.)
- Configurable maximum file size limits
- Priority patterns for important files
- Methods for file discovery, filtering, and analysis
- Statistics gathering and reporting
- Asynchronous processing with controlled concurrency

### Command-Line Interface
A user-friendly CLI has been implemented with the following features:
- Easy-to-use command-line arguments
- Support for different AI providers
- Configurable concurrency and batch size
- Progress reporting with a progress bar
- Output formatting options
- JSON file output

## Testing

All tests are passing, including:
- Unit tests for the `RepositoryScanner` class
- CLI interface tests
- Integration with the AI File Type Analyzer
- Asynchronous processing tests

## Usage

To scan a repository:

```bash
repo-scanner /path/to/repository --provider mock
```

Advanced options:
```bash
repo-scanner /path/to/repository \
    --provider mistral \
    --api-key YOUR_API_KEY \
    --concurrency 10 \
    --batch-size 20 \
    --output results.json \
    --async
```

## Next Steps

- Implement the Analysis Caching System (REPO-01-TASK-03)
- Add comprehensive integration testing (REPO-01-TASK-04)
- Expand to support additional language-specific analysis
