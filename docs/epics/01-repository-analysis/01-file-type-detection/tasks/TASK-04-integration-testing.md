# Engineering Task: Implement Integration Testing

## Task ID
REPO-01-TASK-04

## Parent User Story
[File Type Detection](../01-file-type-detection.md)

## Description
Create integration tests to verify that the AI-based file type detection system correctly identifies file types across various repository structures and file types, ensuring the system meets accuracy and performance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tests cover diverse file types mentioned in the PRD
2. Tests include repositories with:
   - Mixed language codebases
   - Unusual/missing file extensions
   - Configuration files of various formats
   - Documentation files
   - Large files
3. Tests verify accuracy of:
   - File type detection
   - Language identification
   - Purpose determination
4. Tests verify handling of edge cases (binary files, empty files, etc.)
5. Tests measure and verify performance metrics
6. Tests verify caching functionality
7. Tests include AI API failure and retry scenarios
8. Tests are automated and repeatable

## Technical Notes
- Create test fixtures with sample repositories
- Mock AI API responses for predictable testing
- Include AI API failure scenarios
- Measure and report on detection accuracy
- Include performance benchmarks in test output
- Test cache hit rates and performance improvements

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer)
- REPO-01-TASK-02 (Repository Scanner)
- REPO-01-TASK-03 (Analysis Caching System)

## Estimated Effort
Small (4 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Testing with real AI API calls should be limited to avoid unnecessary costs. Most tests should use mocked responses.
