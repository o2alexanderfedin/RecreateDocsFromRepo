# Engineering Task: Implement AI-based File Type Analyzer

## Task ID
REPO-01-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[File Type Detection](../01-file-type-detection.md)

## Description
Create a system that leverages AI models to identify file types, languages, and purposes by analyzing file content and extension. This approach will use AI invocations rather than custom parsers or databases for quick MVP implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System accepts file path and content as input
2. System uses AI model (e.g., GPT-4 or similar) to analyze file
3. Analysis determines:
   - File type (code, configuration, documentation, etc.)
   - Programming language (if applicable)
   - File purpose/role in the codebase
   - Key characteristics for documentation
4. System returns results in a consistent structured format
5. System handles diverse file types (Python, Java, C++, C, C#, R#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, SQL, config files, etc.)
6. System provides confidence level with analysis
7. Analysis completes within acceptable time limits (< 5 seconds per file on average)

## Technical Notes
- Use AI model API invocations (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Design prompt template that efficiently extracts required information
- Implement request throttling and rate limiting
- Include file extension and path as context for the AI
- Consider batching similar files for efficiency
- Implement caching to prevent redundant AI calls
- Handle API errors and implement retry logic

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational task

## Estimated Effort
Medium (8 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
This AI-first approach will allow for rapid development without creating specialized parsers for each language, though it will incur API costs for production use.
