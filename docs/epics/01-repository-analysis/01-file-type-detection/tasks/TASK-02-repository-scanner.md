# Engineering Task: Implement Repository Scanner

## Task ID
REPO-01-TASK-02

## Parent User Story
[File Type Detection](../01-file-type-detection.md)

## Description
Create a system that recursively scans a repository directory structure, identifies all files, and prepares them for AI-based analysis. The scanner will handle file discovery, filtering, and manage the analysis workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Scanner recursively traverses all directories in a given repository path
2. Scanner identifies all files and their relative paths to repository root
3. Scanner filters out binary files, very large files, and common exclusions (.git, node_modules, etc.)
4. Scanner handles repositories of any size with appropriate batching
5. Scanner prioritizes important files for analysis (based on location/name patterns)
6. Scanner coordinates with the AI file type analyzer to process files
7. Scanner manages rate limiting and concurrency for AI requests
8. Scanner produces a structured catalog of all files and their analyzed types
9. Scanner provides progress reporting for large repositories

## Technical Notes
- Use asynchronous processing for I/O operations
- Implement customizable exclusion patterns
- Consider chunking/sampling for very large repositories
- Implement smart batching to reduce API costs
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed analyses
- Include proper error handling
- Log file statistics (counts by type, etc.)

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (8 hours)

## Priority
High

## Status
Completed

## Assignee

## Notes
This scanner should be designed to minimize API costs by filtering obvious files (like known binary formats) before sending to the AI analyzer.
