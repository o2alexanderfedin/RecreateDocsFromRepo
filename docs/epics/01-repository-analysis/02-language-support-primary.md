## Epic

## User Story
As a technical leader, I want the system to analyze code in primary languages (Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript) so that I can understand the most commonly used codebases without manual documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System correctly parses and analyzes Python files:
   - Identifies classes, functions, and methods
   - Extracts docstrings and comments
   - Determines import dependencies
   - Recognizes frameworks and libraries in use

2. System correctly parses and analyzes Java files:
   - Identifies classes, interfaces, and methods
   - Extracts Javadoc comments
   - Determines package dependencies
   - Identifies annotations and their significance

3. System correctly parses and analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript files:
   - Identifies functions, classes, and methods
   - Extracts JSDoc comments
   - Determines import/require dependencies
   - Recognizes frameworks and libraries in use

4. For each language, system can extract:
   - Purpose of the file
   - Key components defined in the file
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Compilation/execution context (if applicable)

5. Analysis completes with acceptable performance on files up to 10MB in size

## Technical Notes
- Will require language-specific parsers
- Abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis for each language
- May need specialized handling for framework-specific patterns
- Consider language-specific static analysis tools integration

## Dependencies
- [01-file-type-detection](01-file-type-detection.md)

## Effort Estimate
Large (4-6 weeks)

## Priority
Must Have (1)
