# User Story: Secondary Language Support

REPO-03

## Epic

## User Story
As a CTO, I want the system to analyze code in secondary languages (C++, C, C#, R#, Rust, SQL, shell scripts) so that I can understand the full technology stack in complex repositories.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System correctly parses and analyzes C++ files:
   - Identifies classes, functions, and methods
   - Extracts comments and documentation
   - Determines include dependencies and their modes
   - Recognizes frameworks and libraries in use

2. System correctly parses and analyzes C files:
   - Identifies functions and structs
   - Extracts comments
   - Determines include dependencies
   - Recognizes common patterns and idioms

3. System correctly parses and analyzes C# files:
   - Identifies classes, interfaces, and methods
   - Extracts XML documentation comments
   - Determines using dependencies
   - Identifies attributes and their significance

4. System correctly parses and analyzes Rust files:
   - Identifies functions, structs, traits, and impls
   - Extracts documentation comments
   - Determines crate dependencies
   - Recognizes unsafe blocks and their purpose

5. System correctly parses SQL, R#, and shell scripts with appropriate metadata extraction

6. For each language, system can extract:
   - Purpose of the file
   - Key components defined in the file
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Compilation/execution context (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Will require language-specific parsers for each language
- May need to integrate with language-specific tools
- Consider performance optimizations for large codebases
- May require specialized handling for language-specific idioms

## Dependencies
- [01-file-type-detection](01-file-type-detection.md)
- [02-language-support-primary](02-language-support-primary.md) (for architecture patterns)

## Effort Estimate
Extra Large (8-10 weeks)

## Priority
Should Have (2)
