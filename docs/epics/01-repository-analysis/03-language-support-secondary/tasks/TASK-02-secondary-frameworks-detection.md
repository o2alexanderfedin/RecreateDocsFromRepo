# Engineering Task: Implement Secondary Frameworks Detection

## Task ID
REPO-03-TASK-02

## Parent User Story
[Secondary Language Support](../03-language-support-secondary.md)

## Description
Create a system to detect and identify frameworks and libraries used in secondary languages (C++, C, C#, R#, Rust, SQL, shell scripts) to provide contextual information for documentation generation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies common frameworks for each secondary language:
   - C++: Qt, Boost, STL, etc.
   - C: Standard libraries, common frameworks
   - C#: .NET Framework, .NET Core, ASP.NET, etc.
   - Rust: Common crates and frameworks
   - SQL: Database types (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Shell scripts: Common utilities and patterns
2. Detection uses both explicit evidence and code patterns
3. System identifies version information when available
4. Detection provides confidence level for each identified framework
5. System extracts framework-specific patterns and structures
6. Results include how frameworks are being used in the codebase
7. Detection works in mixed framework environments

## Technical Notes
- Extend framework detection prompts for secondary languages
- Include common framework signatures in prompts
- Analyze build files and project configuration when available
- Consider global analysis for better detection
- Implement confidence scoring system
- Handle complex C++ include hierarchies

## Dependencies
- REPO-03-TASK-01 (Secondary Language AI Analyzer)
- REPO-02-TASK-02 (Framework Detection) - for architecture reuse

## Estimated Effort
Medium (8 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
Framework detection for secondary languages is more challenging due to the diversity of frameworks and less standardized usage patterns.
