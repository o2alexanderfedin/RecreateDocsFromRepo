# Engineering Task: Implement Metadata Integration

## Task ID
REPO-03-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[Secondary Language Support](../03-language-support-secondary.md)

## Description
Integrate metadata from secondary languages into the standardized metadata schema, ensuring consistency across all languages while preserving language-specific details.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System extends the standardized metadata schema to accommodate secondary language features
2. Integration handles language-specific concepts (e.g., C++ templates, Rust traits) appropriately
3. System converts AI analysis output for secondary languages to the standard schema
4. Integration preserves important language-specific details while normalizing format
5. Metadata from secondary languages seamlessly integrates with primary language metadata
6. Integration handles mixed-language codebases correctly
7. Schema extensibility is maintained for future language additions
8. System generates appropriate compilation/execution instructions for each language

## Technical Notes
- Extend existing metadata schema with secondary language concepts
- Implement adapters for secondary language metadata conversion
- Maintain backward compatibility with primary language schema
- Include language-specific sections in schema where necessary
- Implement validation for schema conformance
- Create mapping for equivalent concepts across languages

## Dependencies
- REPO-02-TASK-03 (Metadata Standardization)
- REPO-03-TASK-01 (Secondary Language AI Analyzer)
- REPO-03-TASK-02 (Secondary Frameworks Detection)

Medium (6 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
This task is crucial for ensuring consistent documentation across multiple languages while preserving the unique aspects of each language.
