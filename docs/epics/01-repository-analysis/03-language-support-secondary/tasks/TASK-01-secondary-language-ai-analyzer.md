# Engineering Task: Implement Secondary Language AI Analyzer

## Task ID
REPO-03-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[Secondary Language Support](../03-language-support-secondary.md)

## Description
Extend the AI-based code analysis system to support secondary languages (C++, C, C#, R#, Rust, SQL, shell scripts) for comprehensive documentation coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System handles code files in all secondary languages
2. Analysis extracts from C++ files:
   - Classes, functions, and methods
   - Include dependencies and modes
   - Inheritance and composition relationships
   - Templates and specializations
3. Analysis extracts from C files:
   - Functions and structs
   - Include dependencies
   - Common patterns and idioms
4. Analysis extracts from C# files:
   - Classes, interfaces, and methods
   - Using directives and namespaces
   - Attributes and their significance
5. Analysis extracts from Rust files:
   - Functions, structs, traits, and impls
   - Crate dependencies
   - Unsafe blocks and their purpose
6. Analysis also handles SQL and shell scripts appropriately
7. Analysis provides consistent metadata format across all languages
8. System provides confidence level with each analysis
9. Analysis completes within acceptable time limits

## Technical Notes
- Extend existing AI prompts to cover secondary languages
- Design language-specific prompt strategies for complex languages
- Implement chunking strategies for large files
- Consider specialized analysis for unique language features
- Include language-specific examples in prompts for better results
- Optimize token usage for cost efficiency

## Dependencies
- REPO-01-TASK-01 (AI File Type Analyzer)
- REPO-02-TASK-01 (AI Code Analyzer) - for architecture reuse

## Estimated Effort
Large (12 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
This task extends the AI analysis approach to more complex languages, which may require more sophisticated prompt engineering and chunking strategies.
