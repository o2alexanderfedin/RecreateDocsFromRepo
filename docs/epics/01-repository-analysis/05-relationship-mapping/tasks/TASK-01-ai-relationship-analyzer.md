# Engineering Task: Implement AI Relationship Analyzer

## Task ID
REPO-05-TASK-01

## Parent User Story
[Relationship Mapping](../05-relationship-mapping.md)

## Description
Create a system that uses AI to identify relationships between files and components in a repository, mapping dependencies, inheritance, implementation, and usage patterns across the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies relationships between components:
   - Import/include dependencies
   - Inheritance relationships
   - Implementation relationships
   - Usage relationships (function calls, instantiation)
   - Service dependencies
2. Analysis works across different languages in the same repository
3. System determines directionality of relationships (which component depends on which)
4. Analysis categorizes components by their role:
   - Core components
   - Utility components
   - Configuration components
   - Test components
   - External dependencies
5. System detects module boundaries and architectural patterns
6. Analysis handles circular dependencies and complex relationship graphs
7. System provides confidence level with relationship identifications
8. Results are returned in a structured, graph-compatible format

## Technical Notes
- Use AI to analyze imports, class hierarchies, and function calls
- Consider cross-file and cross-language analysis approaches
- Design prompts to extract relationship graphs
- Implement multi-pass analysis for complex relationships
- Use explicit code patterns and implicit relationships
- Consider using graph data structures for representing relationships
- Optimize prompts for relationship detection

## Dependencies
- REPO-02-TASK-01 (AI Code Analyzer)
- REPO-03-TASK-01 (Secondary Language AI Analyzer)
- REPO-04-TASK-01 (AI Config Analyzer)

## Estimated Effort
Large (10 hours)

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Not Started

## Assignee
TBD

## Notes
This task forms the foundation for architectural understanding of the codebase and will enable generation of system architecture diagrams.
