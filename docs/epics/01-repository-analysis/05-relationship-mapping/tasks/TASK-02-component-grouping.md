# Engineering Task: Implement Component Grouping

## Task ID
REPO-05-TASK-02

## Parent User Story
[Relationship Mapping](../05-relationship-mapping.md)

## Description
Create a system that identifies and groups related components into modules, subsystems, and layers based on relationship analysis, providing higher-level architectural insights for documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies logical modules in the codebase
2. Grouping uses multiple signals:
   - Directory structure
   - Namespace/package organization
   - Naming conventions
   - Relationship patterns
   - Import/include patterns
3. System detects common architectural patterns:
   - Layered architecture
   - Microservices
   - Model-View-Controller
   - Event-driven architecture
   - etc.
4. Grouping works across different languages in the same codebase
5. System detects boundaries between modules
6. Grouping includes hierarchy (components → modules → subsystems)
7. System assigns meaningful names and descriptions to identified groups
8. Results include relationship information between groups

## Technical Notes
- Use AI to identify patterns in relationships and structure
- Consider hierarchical clustering techniques
- Implement naming strategies for identified modules
- Use global analysis to identify broader patterns
- Consider using community detection algorithms for grouping
- Include module boundary detection
- Leverage existing architectural knowledge in prompts

## Dependencies
- REPO-05-TASK-01 (AI Relationship Analyzer)

## Notes
Component grouping provides a higher-level view of the system architecture, making complex systems more understandable.
