# Engineering Task: Implement Relationship Visualization

## Task ID
REPO-05-TASK-03

## Parent User Story
[Relationship Mapping](../05-relationship-mapping.md)

## Description
Create a system that generates visualizations of component relationships and architectural groupings using UML diagrams following the 4+1 View Model, rendered in PlantUML or Mermaid syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System generates visualizations for different architectural views:
   - Logical View (class diagrams, component diagrams)
   - Process View (sequence diagrams, activity diagrams)
   - Development View (package diagrams)
   - Physical View (deployment diagrams)
   - Scenarios View (use case diagrams)
2. Diagrams use PlantUML or Mermaid syntax
3. Visualization handles different levels of detail:
   - System overview diagrams
   - Module detail diagrams
   - Component interaction diagrams
4. System avoids overly complex diagrams through appropriate clustering
5. Diagrams include meaningful labels and relationships
6. Visualization includes layout optimization for readability
7. System generates consistent styling across diagrams
8. Diagrams include relevant metadata (dates, version info, etc.)

## Technical Notes
- Design templates for different diagram types
- Implement graph layout algorithms for complex relationships
- Create strategies for handling large component sets
- Consider using AI for generating diagram descriptions
- Implement filtering for different detail levels
- Optimize diagram generation for readability
- Include legend/key information in diagrams

## Dependencies
- REPO-05-TASK-01 (AI Relationship Analyzer)
- REPO-05-TASK-02 (Component Grouping)

## Notes
Visualization is crucial for understanding complex system architectures and will be a key deliverable for the documentation generation process.
