# Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm - Epics and User Stories

This document provides an overview of all epics and user stories for the Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm project, with AI-based implementation.

## Epics

The project is divided into the following major epics:

1. [Repository Analysis](01-repository-analysis/epic.md) - Core repository scanning and analysis functionality
2. [Documentation Generation](02-documentation-generation/epic.md) - Generation of documentation from analysis data

## Epic: Repository Analysis

The Repository Analysis epic focuses on AI-based scanning and analysis of code repositories across multiple languages.

### User Stories:

| Story ID | Story | Priority | Story Points | Status | Tasks | Effort |

| **Total** | | | **63** | | | **114h** |

## Epic: Documentation Generation

The Documentation Generation epic focuses on creating comprehensive, well-organized documentation from the repository analysis data.

### User Stories:

| Story ID | Story | Priority | Story Points | Status | Tasks | Effort |
|----------|-------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|--------|
| DOC-01 | [File Metadata Documentation](02-documentation-generation/01-file-metadata-documentation.md) | P1 | 8 | Not Started | [Tasks](02-documentation-generation/01-file-metadata-documentation/tasks.md) | 16h |
| DOC-02 | [UML Diagram Generation](02-documentation-generation/02-uml-diagram-generation.md) | P1 | 13 | Not Started | [Tasks](02-documentation-generation/02-uml-diagram-generation/tasks.md) | 18h |
| DOC-03 | [Documentation Organization](02-documentation-generation/03-documentation-organization.md) | P1 | 8 | Not Started | [Tasks](02-documentation-generation/03-documentation-organization/tasks.md) | 14h |
| **Total** | | | **29** | | | **48h** |

## Prioritization and Story Points Summary

| Priority | Count | Story Points | % of Total | Engineering Hours | % of Hours |
|----------|-------|--------------|------------|------------------|------------|
| Must Have (P1) | 6 | 50 | 54% | 104h | 64% |
| Should Have (P2) | 2 | 42 | 46% | 58h | 36% |
| **Total** | **8** | **92** | **100%** | **162h** | **100%** |

## Implementation Approach

The implementation is based on an AI-first approach:

1. **AI-Driven Analysis**: Using AI models to analyze file types, code structure, and relationships rather than building custom parsers for each language.

2. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Optimizing AI usage through batching, caching, and smart filtering to manage costs while maintaining quality.

3. **UML 4+1 View Model**: Following the standard UML 4+1 View Model for comprehensive architecture documentation.

4. **Incremental Value**: Prioritizing must-have stories that provide immediate value before expanding to more complete capabilities.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (MVP) - 104 hours
- REPO-01: File Type Detection
- REPO-02: Primary Language Support
- REPO-04: Config File Analysis
- DOC-01: File Metadata Documentation
- DOC-02: UML Diagram Generation
- DOC-03: Documentation Organization

### Phase 2 (Complete) - 58 additional hours
- REPO-03: Secondary Language Support
- REPO-05: Relationship Mapping

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are to begin implementation of the Phase 1 tasks, starting with the core File Type Detection and analysis capabilities.
