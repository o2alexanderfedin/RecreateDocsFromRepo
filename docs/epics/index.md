# Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm - Epics and User Stories

This document provides an overview of all epics and user stories for the Documentation Recreation Agent Swarm project.

## Epics

The project is divided into the following major epics:

1. [Repository Analysis](01-repository-analysis/epic.md) - Core repository scanning and analysis functionality
2. [Documentation Generation](02-documentation-generation/epic.md) - Generation of documentation from analysis data

## Epic: Repository Analysis

The Repository Analysis epic focuses on the core functionality of scanning and analyzing code repositories across multiple languages.
